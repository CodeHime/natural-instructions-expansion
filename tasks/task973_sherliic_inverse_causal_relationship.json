      "Definition": "Given two sentences, P and Q, determine if sentence Q is the correct premise for hypothesis sentence P. If sentence Q is the premise of sentence P, the answer \"yes\" else \"no\". If sentences P and Q use the same verb-pronoun pairs, then the answer should be \"no\".",

                  "explanation": "The sentences location[A] is pointing at region[B] and region[B] is cooperating with location[A] imply the opposite to each other and hence they share no relation."
