      "Definition": "Given two sentences, P and Q, determine if P is the premise and Q the hypothesis or Q is the premise of P. If P is the premise and Q the hypothesis, the answer would be \"PQ\". If Q is the premise and P the hypothesis, the answer would be \"QP\". If P and Q are not a premise-hypothesis pair, answer \"NO\". If P and Q are premise-hypothesis pairs of each other, that is, both PQ and QP are valid, then answer \"YES\".",

Location B is the centered in location A(Sentence Q), implies that Location B is a city of location A(Sentence P). Since both are true, the answer is \"YES\"."
