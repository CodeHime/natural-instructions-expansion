      "Definition": "In this task, you will be given a fact as input, a possible annotation and some examples. The fact will always contain exactly two placeholders [object-type1] and [object-type2], with examples that can fill them according to their type, e.g. if [location], then examples[location] would all be of type location. You will also be given an annotation. Assuming the fact is true, determine if the annotation correctly explains the fact. If the annotation does explain it, answer \"yes\" or \"no\". If it is incomprehensible, state \"no\".",

                  "explanation": "A nation is a community of people of similar characteristics/descent with a common government. A country is a region sharing a common government. Hence, a nation can be defined as a country. The annotation remains true for given examples as well."
