      "Definition": "In this task, you will be given a fact, a possible annotation and some examples. The fact will always contain exactly two placeholders [A] and [B], with some examples for both. You will also be given a possible annoation of the fact. Assume that the fact holds true for the given examples. Tell if, given, the fact is true, the annotation is also true. If the annotation holds true, answer \"yes\", \"no\" or \"incomprehensible\". ",
